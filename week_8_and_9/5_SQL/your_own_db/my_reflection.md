I have a strong interest in learning more about SQL and database management. Particularly I like MySQL and postgresql. I would like to see how I can enter large amounts of data into the database at once as well as how to create a dynamica database that can make changes on its own, such as time elapsed. I see a lot of potential uses for SQL and it's integration into applications. I look forward to learning more about SQL!
