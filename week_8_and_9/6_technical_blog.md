# U3.W8-9: Technical Blog 

## Learning Competencies
- Research a topic of interest
- Teach others about the topic


## Release 0: Copy Your Blog Template
Copy your blog tempate into a new HTML file named `week8_technical.html`.

## Release 1: Research

There are a lot of interesting topics we haven't covered in Phase 0, but will be important for your success at DBC and Beyond. Find a topic that interests you (or create one) and research it. We don't expect you to be experts in any of these, but try to teach others a high level understanding of what it is.

- Active Record
- Big O Complexity and Notation
- Computer Memory
- Dynamic vs. Static Typed Languages
- How computers work
- How the Internet Works
- Recursion
- Regular Expressions 
- Sorting (merge sort, quick sort, bubble sort)
- Test-Driven Development
- What is Rails?
- Web Security


## Release 2: Blog!
Write a blog post about what you learned. Teach your audience and future employer!

## Release 3: Submission
Link to your blog on the index of your github.io site and sync your changes.

	What is Rails?

	While searching for an answer to "What is Rails?" I came across RailsGuides and after having wondered around for awhile throught the documentation and experimenting with setting up a Rails environment I couldn't have been happier to discover RailsGuides. So without further adu, bellow you will find their version of "What is Rails" which I hope can be as helpful for you as it was for me! 

	http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html

		Rails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby language. It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started. It allows you to write less code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks. Experienced Rails developers also report that it makes web application development more fun.

		Rails is opinionated software. It makes the assumption that there is the "best" way to do things, and it's designed to encourage that way - and in some cases to discourage alternatives. If you learn "The Rails Way" you'll probably discover a tremendous increase in productivity. If you persist in bringing old habits from other languages to your Rails development, and trying to use patterns you learned elsewhere, you may have a less happy experience.

		The Rails philosophy includes two major guiding principles:

		Don't Repeat Yourself: DRY is a principle of software development which states that "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system." By not writing the same information over and over again, our code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy.
		Convention Over Configuration: Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web application, and defaults to this set of conventions, rather than require that you specify every minutiae through endless configuration files.
	
	Their guide goes far beyond the explanation of what rails is and gives you step by step instruction on how to set your own rails environment up. Having been curious I decided to go along and set up the rails framework for a blog application. What caught my attention the most about following their guides was their table which took each File/Folder and told us its Purpose. See Below:

	<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>File/Folder</th>
<th>Purpose</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>app/</td>
<td>Contains the controllers, models, views, helpers, mailers and assets for your application. You'll focus on this folder for the remainder of this guide.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>bin/</td>
<td>Contains the rails script that starts your app and can contain other scripts you use to deploy or run your application.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>config/</td>
<td>Configure your application's routes, database, and more. This is covered in more detail in <a href="configuring.html">Configuring Rails Applications</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>config.ru</td>
<td>Rack configuration for Rack based servers used to start the application.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>db/</td>
<td>Contains your current database schema, as well as the database migrations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gemfile<br>Gemfile.lock</td>
<td>These files allow you to specify what gem dependencies are needed for your Rails application. These files are used by the Bundler gem. For more information about Bundler, see <a href="http://gembundler.com">the Bundler website</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>lib/</td>
<td>Extended modules for your application.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>log/</td>
<td>Application log files.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>public/</td>
<td>The only folder seen by the world as-is. Contains static files and compiled assets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rakefile</td>
<td>This file locates and loads tasks that can be run from the command line. The task definitions are defined throughout the components of Rails. Rather than changing Rakefile, you should add your own tasks by adding files to the lib/tasks directory of your application.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>README.rdoc</td>
<td>This is a brief instruction manual for your application. You should edit this file to tell others what your application does, how to set it up, and so on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>test/</td>
<td>Unit tests, fixtures, and other test apparatus. These are covered in <a href="testing.html">Testing Rails Applications</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>tmp/</td>
<td>Temporary files (like cache, pid, and session files).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>vendor/</td>
<td>A place for all third-party code. In a typical Rails application this includes vendored gems.</td>
</tr>

	This table does a fine job at teaching you the basic intentions of the Rails framework so much so that I continued to want to learn how our Rails environment would work with our Git environment. Don't want to spoil that experience to much right now! So check back in a few days (when I have more time to go down that rabit hole) and I'll be sure to upload my experience with combining these two environments!
