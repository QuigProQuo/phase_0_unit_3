Based on the viedeo, what's your take on the DBC experience?
	After having had the opportunity to watch Shereef's Fireside Chat and hear from the creator of DBC what his intentions and expectations are of the program as a whole I am extremely anxious, excited, nervous, but ready. Ready because I know I'm going to be in a very supportive environment despite any knowledge gap that may be present between fellow students. Ready because the people chosen for this program were carefully accepted by the interviewers to have an extremely positive outlook on life and their well being. Ready because we have all going to be trying something new together with support from our peers and teachers. Ready because no matter the level of talent you walk in with, if you try your best and give it your all you will walk out having learned something. 

	But I can't say all this readiness comes worry free. I mentioned above  that I'm anxious, excited, and nervous at the same time. The reason being is because this is something I haven't done before, it's out of my comfort zone, and I want to be great and succeed in the DevBootcamp environment. Stepping into this program is going to require me to let go of any previous misconceptions about myself.

	Luckily I feel Shereef has outlined a great strategy to accept people into the program and keep them in the program. Leaving individuals with the only option to fail as simply to not try at all. If there is an effort DBC is willing to work with us. 

	Being in an environment where others are looking to learn with the ultimate outcome being a job can be hard to find ways to create a curriculum that inspires its students to learn for the right reasons. I feel this is where DBC set's itself apart from other programs. It encourages human growth rather than financial growth. Saying that in time, with human growth your financial growth will being to prosper. I feel this to be true to the core because during these past 9 weeks I feel I have learned more about myself than I did in the past 3 years of college. 

	With all that has been said I look forward to the challenges that are set in front of me the next coming weeks. I believe that I, with the support of the DBC community, will be able to overcome any nerves, feelings, or misconceptions that I may have about the program or myself. Phase 1 here I come! -->
