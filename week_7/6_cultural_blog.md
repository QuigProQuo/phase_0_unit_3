Recently I have come across a meditation app called heaspace which preaches 10 minutes of meditation a day. Their approach focuses on calming & insight meditation. These methods bring about greater calm, clarity, and improved feelings of wellbeing and happiness. Having tried their 10 minutes for 10 day program I have become a firm believer in taking 10 minutes out of my day to do nothing but refocus my thoughts. It is my firm belief that I am equiped with the knowledge to handle any stereotype threat I may face throughout life. Not only have the past couple of weeks encouraged me to learn more about web developing but more about myself. I now make a honest attempt to observe my suroundings and take action accordingly, thus being able to combat any stereotype threats that may come my way.
