Description of what you're modeling: 

In this assignment I was envisioning what a software company outline would look like. Covering the Operating System, Company, and Company's Operating System. But I had trouble representing my connection keys correctly. 

I believe their intentions will be understood when view the picture but I was hope to connect operating_system name to operating_system_name and company_operating_system id to company id, ending with company category going to operating_system company_category. Each represent a one to many schema with the category company representing the many to many schema.

## Release 5: Reflection
I don't know that I completely understood these schemas or if I tried to do something more complicated than what I envisioned from the start. I was hoping to show the relationship between an operating system such as iOS and its relationship with Apple, using a go bewteen. This graph may not accurately portray but beyond the schema I tried to make I found the other exercise to be good practice for understanding the different types of schemas/
